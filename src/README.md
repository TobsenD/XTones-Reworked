# Xtones Reworked
This is a port of the Mod [Xtones from TehNut](https://github.com/TehNut/Xtones).

The code was rewritten from scratch and the existing textures were kept.

The scrolling behavior for the variants was reworked to usual Minecraft recipes with either Dye or the Stonecutter.

## Note
I will try to offer this mod also for other Forge versions. A port to Fabric will not exist from my side, because I don't play Fabric. Feel free to use the code though, the MIT license has been kept.
