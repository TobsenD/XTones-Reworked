# Xtones Reworked
This is a port of the Mod [Xtones from TehNut](https://github.com/TehNut/Xtones).

The code was rewritten from scratch and the existing textures were kept.

The scrolling behavior for the variants was reworked to usual Minecraft recipes with either Dye or the Stonecutter.

## Note
I won't continue Forge Support and concentrate on Neoforged, but I will start to support a fabric project for this mod.

# Special Thanks to

[Wheelz0](https://github.com/Wheelz0) for the port to 1.16.5.
